# arduino_ozone_ze25-o3

Coded this for a blog post on https://www.babyfriendlyair.com where I played
around with this sensor.

The data is just written to "Serial" so that it can easily be stored
by `cat /dev/ttyACM0 > data` for instance (on Arch Linux at least).

Sorry if I offend anyone by not following Arduino or C++ conventions,
this is the first time I play around with an Arduino and first time
in many years I code C++.
